# QuoteRunner

### Goal
Display one quote a day

### Plan
Some thoughts on QuoteRunner by phase:
- Phase 1: Quick and scratchy: get it up running (UI/quotes in memory?)
- Phase 2: Connect with database to render quote content
- Phase 3: Allow user input to add quotes (and confirmation process?)
- Phase 4: Add search
- Phase 5: Have an autocomplete?
- Phase 6: Incorporate speach AI?
